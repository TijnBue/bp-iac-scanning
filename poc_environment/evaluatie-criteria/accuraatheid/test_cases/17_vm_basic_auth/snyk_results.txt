[0m[1mLow Severity Issues: 2[22m[0m

  [0m[Low] [1mVirtual Network DDoS protection plan disabled[22m[0m
  Info:    Virtual Network DDoS protection plan disabled. Services deployed in
           the network will not benefit from advanced DDoS protection features
           such as attack alerting and analytics
  Rule:    [4mhttps://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-AZURE-516[24m
  Path:    resource > azurerm_virtual_network[main] > ddos_protection_plan
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `ddos_protection_plan.enable` attribute to `true`

  [0m[Low] [1mVM Agent is not provisioned automatically for Windows[22m[0m
  Info:    VM Agent is not provisioned automatically for Windows. VM Agent
           reduces management overhead by enabling straightforward bootstrapping
           of monitoring and configuration of guest OS
  Rule:    [4mhttps://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-AZURE-667[24m
  Path:    resource > azurerm_virtual_machine[main] > os_profile_windows_config
           > provision_vm_agent
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `os_profile_windows_config.provision_vm_agent` to `true`

[0m[1mHigh Severity Issues: 2[22m[0m

  [31m[High] [1mVirtual machine is configured with password authentication for admin[22m[39m
  Info:    Administrative password has been set in configuration file. The
           secret value will be readable to anyone with access to VCS, which can
           lead to unauthorized data disclosure or privilege escalation
  Rule:    [4mhttps://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-TF-263[24m
  Path:    resource > azurerm_virtual_machine[main] > os_profile >
           admin_password
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `admin_ssh_key` attribute instead of password authentication

  [31m[High] [1mLinux virtual machine has password authentication enabled[22m[39m
  Info:    Linux virtual machine has password authentication enabled. Password
           authentication is less resistant to brute force and educated guess
           attacks then SSH public key authentication
  Rule:    [4mhttps://security.snyk.io/rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-TF-79[24m
  Path:    resource > azurerm_virtual_machine[main] > os_profile_linux_config >
           disable_password_authentication
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `disable_password_authentication` attribute to `true` or remove
           the attribute
